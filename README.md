## 🌟 Projects I've Worked On

Here are a few projects that reflect what I've learned and accomplished during my studies:

### :video_game: Bubbles
- **Description:** This is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project where I developed a game called **Bubbles**. The game incorporates core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Players interact with objects like a spaceship and bubble blocks, with game mechanics that include object collision, user input, and score tracking.
- **Technologies Used:** C#, OOP
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/shanielgamil/bubbles)

### 📊 BreastCancerClassifier
- **Description:** This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. The project was created as part of a Machine Learning course. The model was trained on a breast cancer dataset, applying various classification algorithms to predict the presence of cancer based on features such as size, shape, and texture.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset:** [Link to datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xmdHvW-nqC8fD1rcwlVWpo61xBODbJ8y?usp=drive_link)
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/InbalBolshinsky/Assigment-2-ML)
  
### :memo: LearnUp
- **Description:** LearnUp is an online learning platform designed for students and teachers. It allows users to enroll in courses, access educational materials, and participate in exercises with real-time feedback. The project was created as part of the "Software Engineering" course, with a focus on the architectural structure of the project - providing the requirements and architecture documentation for the LearnUp platform. The documents describe the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the technical architecture and system components. These documents serve as the foundation for understanding the project’s goals and design.
- **Technologies Used:** Varius UML Diagrams using Lucidchart
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/InbalBolshinsky/LearnUp)

### :black_joker: TAKI Game
- **Description:** This was my first ever coding project! This is a card game project where I implemented the game TAKI. The game allows players to compete by matching cards based on number or color, with special cards altering gameplay. Key features include player input handling, game state management, and dynamic turn-based mechanics.
- **Technologies Used:** C
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/InbalBolshinsky/TAKI-Game)
