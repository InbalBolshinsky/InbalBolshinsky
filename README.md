## 🌟 Projects I've Worked On

Here are a few projects that reflect what I've learned and accomplished during my studies:

### 🌈🛡️ TransDefender (Dykathon 2025 – 1st Place)  
- **Description:** Chrome extension supporting respectful online dialogue by detecting and addressing harmful language.  
- **Highlights:** Detects transphobic remarks, generates AI-driven responses, integrates Azure GPT-4o-mini and Hebrew toxicity detection models.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, in collaboration with the Gila Project.  

### 🖼️ Pixel Interpolation Perception Quality Prediction (PQPI)  
- **Description:** Samsung collaboration (Summer 2025) on predicting human perception of pixel interpolation quality.  
- **Highlights:** Designed a multi-dataset deep learning pipeline, applied ensembling and fine-tuning, accelerated development cycles for new methods.  

### 🤖 QuickAssist – LLM-Based Customer Service Assistant  
- **Description:** NLP course project + independent research extension.  
- **Highlights:** Compared intent-first vs. direct response paradigms using GPT-4, T5, and BERT on benchmark datasets.  
- **Evaluation:** BERTScore, ROUGE, BLEU, and human assessments. Currently being developed into a research paper: *“Do Large Language Models Need Intent?”*  

### 🧞 QueryGenie
- **Description:** QueryGenie is an AI-powered business insights assistant built during the **8th National Israeli Hackathon.** It translates natural-language job descriptions into SQL queries and generates interactive visualizations using Chart.js. The system supports MySQL databases, integrates with OpenAI, and features retry/fallback logic for empty results. The frontend is built with React and includes a Lottie-powered loading animation and a fully responsive layout.
- **Technologies Used:** FastAPI, React, TypeScript, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Chart.js, OpenAI
- **Features:** AI-generated SQL from job prompts, fallback logic, Chart.js-based insights, MySQL schema introspection.
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/InbalBolshinsky/QueryGenie)

### 🧮 MyMath:
- **Description:** The MyMath project is a kids-friendly, web-based application designed to make learning math fun and engaging for elementary school students. It features a range of math exercises tailored to different grade levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) with interactive elements, animations, and a rewarding achievement system. The project includes a secure login and sign-in system with MongoDB-backed data persistence, enabling personalized experiences and progress tracking for young learners.
- **Technologies Used:** React, Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Features:** User authentication, personalized exercises, progress saving, score tracking, trophies for achievements, and a variety of math problems ranging from basic addition to advanced fractions and percentages.
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/InbalBolshinsky/MyMath)

### 🩺 LungCancer_DL_Project:
- **Description:** This project, completed as part of a Deep Learning course, classifies lung cancer images into Benign, Malignant, and Normal cases using CNNs and Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet). It applies data augmentation, class balancing, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. The study compares a custom CNN model against pre-trained models to determine the most effective approach.
- **Technologies Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, KerasTuner.
- **Dataset:** [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamahimkar/iqothnccd-lung-cancer-dataset/data)
