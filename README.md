## 🌟 Projects I've Worked On

Here are a few projects that reflect what I've learned and accomplished during my studies:

### 📚 Bubbles
- **Description:** This is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project where I developed a game called **Bubbles**. The game incorporates core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Players interact with objects like a spaceship and bubble blocks, with game mechanics that include object collision, user input, and score tracking.
- **Technologies Used:** C#, OOP
- **Repo:** [Link to GitHub repository]

### 📊 BreastCancerClassifier
- **Description:** This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. The model was trained on a breast cancer dataset, applying various classification algorithms to predict the presence of cancer based on features such as size, shape, and texture.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset:** (https://md.hit.ac.il/pluginfile.php/914794/mod_folder/content/0/cancer_test.csv?forcedownload=1)
